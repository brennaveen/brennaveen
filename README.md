# Hi, I'm Brenna!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennaveen/brennaveen/master/banner.png" alt="Banner - Brenna Veen, developer">

I'm a full stack developer who loves making applications that are both beautiful and usable on the frontend and the backend. I work on a wide variety of project types (web development, SQL, integration, data transmission, etc), but most of the time I am working on web development. Right now I'm really loving TailwindCSS and AlpineJS for my web projects!
